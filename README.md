# learnyounode - my solutions

> Learn You The Node.js For Much Win! An intro to Node.js via a set of self-guided workshops.


(WIP) These are my solutions for the learnyounode's exercises. 
   
Please **bare in mind** that I'm just learning this stuff and I am in no way an expert in JS or Node.js. These _probably_ aren't the best solutions for these problems.
